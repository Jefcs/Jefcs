- 👋 Hi, my name is Jefferson also known as Jeff. I've been learning Frontend for web application for a few months now and I'll be updating more code here more often. Right now my profile here is a bit of a mess but I'll straight things out and make it clearer.
- 👀 I’m interested in cutting-edge techonology. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning typescript and Nuxt.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Frontend web application. If you need any help building your application, reach out to me - maybe I can help with a few lines of code.
- 📫 How to reach me jeffersonc.silva@hotmail.com
